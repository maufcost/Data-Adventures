Data Adventures – Week 1

In this series, Data Adventures, I will highlight what I have learnt in the fascinating fields of machine learning, 
data science, computer vision, and other programming concepts for the past week in outside-of-the-classroom projects 
I have been conducting. 

This is one of the ways that I can use to keep track of my progress and raise self-awareness of the areas I need to 
improve and invest more time in.

Let’s begin!

The first half of my week was entirely devoted to improving my knowledge on data science. That being said, my main goal 
was to get used and more comfortable with libraries, such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. As I am very interested in 
the intricacies of owning a business and analyzing business statistics, such as revenues, most sold items, and busiest 
time ranges during the days, I found out that I could merge my interests in data science and business by exploring some 
business statistics with publicly available datasets.

Projects:
•	Analyzed a store’s Black Friday sales.\n
•	Analyzed revenues, most sold items, and busiest times of the day at the Bread Basket Bakery.\n

The second half of the last week was amazing! I could “dive deep” in deep learning by sharpening my knowledge of normal 
feed-forward and convolutional neural networks (I am enthralled by it!) for image recognition.

Projects:
•	Trained a model that can identify items of clothing with the MNIST dataset.\n
•	Trained a model that can identify handwritten letters with the MNIST dataset.\n
•	Developed a model that can deal with more complex images that managed to distinguish between human beings and horses.\n
•	I could finally write, from scratch, algorithms that perform 2D convolutions and pooling.\n
•	Learned about callbacks, image data generators, epoch steps, and data augmentattion to avoid overfitting and improve 
model accuracy.

These fields have turned out to be what I am really interested about and are what I currently spent most of my time with. 
With them, I can merge my interests of business and technology, and now with Data Adventures, I can keep developing myself 
and improving each week.

Thanks for reading and feel free to reach me out if you would like to talk more about it!
