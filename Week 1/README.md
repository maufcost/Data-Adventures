# Data Adventures: Week 1

### In this series, Data Adventures, I will highlight what I have learnt in the fascinating fields of machine learning, data science, computer vision, and other programming concepts for the past week in outside-of-the-classroom projects I have been conducting. 

With Data Adventures, I intend to keep track of my weekly progress, merge my interests in business and technology, and raise self-awareness of the areas I need to improve and invest more time in.

Week 1â€™s insight: from analyzing Black Friday sales and finding out the most sold products at the Bread Basket Bakery to creating classifiers that can distinguish between human beings and horses and learning more about callbacks and data augmentation, last week was fascinating and full of new concepts and approaches to analyzing business data and building efficient convolutional neural networks.

Projects:
* Analyzed metrics, such as sales and busiest time ranges of the day of the Bread Basket Bakery
* Analyzed Black Friday sales from a particular store.
* Used Tensor Flow and Keras to create classifiers to distinguish between cats and dogs, and horses and humans.
* Built convolutional neural networks!
* Managed to write in Python, from scratch, how convolutions and poolings algorithms
* And a lot more!

These fields have turned out to be what I am really interested about and are what I currently spend most of my time with.

Thanks for reading and feel free to reach me out if you would like to talk more about it!

Mauricio.
