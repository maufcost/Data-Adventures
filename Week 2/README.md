# Data Adventures - Week 2

### In this series, Data Adventures, I will highlight what I have learnt in the fascinating fields of machine learning, data science, computer vision, and other programming concepts for the past week in outside-of-the-classroom projects I have been conducting.
This is one of the ways that I can use to keep track of my progress and raise self-awareness of the areas I need to improve and invest more time in.

This week I finished Coursera’s second course on their Tensor Flow specialization focused on convolutional neural networks. I managed to build classifiers using tensor flow’s image augmentation library and transfer learning using the Inception model. By using pre-trained neural networks, I managed to reach astounding accuracy values! Still in this second week, I also built multi-class models to identify hand gestures as rock, paper, or scissors. Amazing!
I have also practiced a lot of web scraping using Python’s Beuatiful Soup and urllib libraries and dived deep in Django! I had prior experience in Django and this week was perfect to dive a lot deeper in using this fabulous framework.

Projects:
* Created a classifier using data augmentation to identify humans and horses.
* Developed a multi-class model that recognizes rocks, paper, and scissors based on shapes made by pictures of computer-generated human hands.
* Learned how to leverage Tensor Flow’s transfer learning capabilities using the pre-trained Inception model.
* Scraped websites to collect data for a future Django project (who will be posted in another week in the future) and started to develop a fully functional website powered by Django.

These fields have turned out to be what I am really interested about and are what I currently spent most of my time with. With them, I can merge my interests of business and technology, and now with Data Adventures, I can keep developing myself and improving each week.

Thanks for reading and feel free to reach me out if you would like to talk more about it!
Mauricio.
